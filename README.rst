naco_pip - planet detecting pipeline
=======================================================

Introduction
------------

``naco_pip`` Is a python-based pipeline relying on routines from the Vortex Image Processing (VIP) package in order to reduce VLT/NACO data acquired with or without the AGPM coronagraph.

Use of the pipeline is currently at your own risk as bugs might still be present.

If you would like to make use of the pipeline, contact me: valentin.christiaens@monash.edu.
A publication is in preparation and the code will be released afterwards.
