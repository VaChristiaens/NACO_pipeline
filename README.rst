naco_pip - Reduction pipeline for VLT/NACO data
================================================

Introduction
------------

``naco_pip`` Is a python-based pipeline relying on routines from the Vortex Image Processing (VIP) package in order to reduce VLT/NACO data acquired with or without the AGPM coronagraph.
VIP is available at: https://github.com/vortex-exoplanet/VIP

The use of this pipeline is currently at your own risk as bugs might still be present.

If you would like to make use of the pipeline, contact me: valentin.christiaens@monash.edu.
A publication is in preparation and the code will be released afterwards.
